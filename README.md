ðŸŽ® Project: Hangman Game
Description:

A classic Hangman word-guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The game challenges players to guess a hidden word by selecting letters from the alphabet. Incorrect guesses gradually draw the hangman figure. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the word or exhausts all attempts.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used:
HTML â€“ Structured the game layout and elements.

CSS â€“ Styled the interface for a clean, responsive design, including animations for the hangman drawing.

JavaScript â€“ Managed game logic, letter checking, win/loss detection, and UI interaction.

âœ… Key Features:
Random word selection from a predefined list.

Dynamic UI updates based on user input.

Display of correctly guessed letters and wrong attempts.

Hangman figure drawn step-by-step for each wrong guess.

Win/lose message with an option to restart the game.

Fully responsive design compatible with desktop and mobile browsers.

ðŸ’¡ What I Learned:
DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

State management in a small-scale game.

Creating interactive and responsive UI with pure CSS and JS.

Handling edge cases (repeated guesses, non-letter inputs, etc.).
